## About the Internship
As a Python Development Intern at **ShadowFox**, I worked on multiple projects that honed my skills in Python programming, web scraping, data analysis, and interactive game development. I also practiced data extraction on various websites and completed several intermediate-level tasks, including comprehensive data analysis using Python libraries.

## Tasks Completed

### Web Scraping Project
I developed a web scraper to extract data from websites using **Beautiful Soup**. The project involved:
- Handling errors and exceptions.
- Saving the scraped data in a structured format.
- Ensuring efficient and accurate data extraction.

### Interactive Hangman Game
I created an interactive **Hangman** game using Python. The game features:
- Visual progress indicators for the player.
- Win/loss conditions.
- Replay options for continuous gameplay.

### Data Analysis with Python
I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a **Retail sales dataset** using Python libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. The analysis involved:
- Importing and cleaning the dataset.
- Performing data manipulations and transformations.
- Visualizing key insights, such as:
  - Gross sales overtime and Profit/Loss overtime
  - Cost breakdown
  - Financial metrics by Fiscal years
  - Correlation matrix
  - Manufacturing Costs vs Net Sales and Freight Costs vs Profit/Loss
  - Trends of Manufacturing Costs, Freight Costs, and Profit/Loss Over Fiscal Years
    

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Web Scraping Frameworks**: Beautiful Soup
- **Data Analysis Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**: Pycharm, Jupyter Notebook
- **Data Formats**:  CSV
